This program allows to save and read information using Formatter and Scanner class respectively.

Before running this program, it necessary to copy the whole of estateManagement folder inside the setup folder.
This estateManagement serves as a local database forb this program, therefore to save the data this folder needs to be 
created in the root directory (i.e. C:\estateManagement).
 
Information can be altered and deleted but restoration of deleted information automatically 
has not been coded, but can be checked manually on the hard drive by following the Garbage URL: "C:\estateManagement\ZGarbage".
All images and icon used in this program are located in this URL: "C:\estateManagement\Resources\".

The real inspiration behind this program is to create something for agents in Nigeria who deals in leasing properies. There is need 
for them to keep records of their clients, date they moved in, and when their rent will expire.
